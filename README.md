# Calm-Down

This is an extremely basic html/js website deployed on heroku.  
The website (as of now) consists of a nothing but a button, which on being clicked generates a random question.  
I made this for my girlfriend, who suffers from anxiety attacks. We've found that answering questions like this about herself
is an effective way of calming down.  
I made this website in the rare case that I was unreachable and she needed to do the exercise herself
